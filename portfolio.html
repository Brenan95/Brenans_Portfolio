            <p4>The Inscrutable Box of Mysteries was a box label designed for a makeup company. It was used for boxes of makeup that had random products in it. The company was nerd theme'd so they wanted an 8 bit design.</p4>

            <p4>A beach resort needed a joke postcard that seemed just cheesey enough but still shared beautiful views of their resort. What better way to do that than giant squid tentacles coming out of the water? </p4>
